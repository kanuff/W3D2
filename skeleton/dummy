The purpose of this exercise is to learn the box model and the differences between the three primary display properties (block, inline, inline-block). The anchor tags from step 2 are naturally inline elements, which is why act oddly when provided padding. Spacing with margin and padding is vital to mastering CSS design. We also used the inline-block property to get practice positioning elements to create a desired layout.

Update box_model.css as follows to practice styling with different display and spacing properties.



Apply a display property to position the aside and section next to each other. Space them out with a 15px margin-right on the aside.

If you find your ingredients list aligned to the bottom use the developer tools to find and correct the styling.



Use the display property to put input elements on their own row. At this point it probably looks better to remove the "Cooking Expertise" and "Rating" labels.

Space out the select element with margin and assign widths to the text input, select, and textarea to finish up our form.

Challenge: There is a reason we only gave the aside a margin-right of 15px when it should have been 20px to constitute the full 900px of the body. To see what I am talking about, jump into the dev tools, check off the margin-right on the aside, and apply a border-left 1px solid black on the aside and a border-left 1px solid black on the section. Why is there still a space between the borders? Research why and test some corrections.
